## Our Research Focus

At SinhaLab, we build computational methods to better understand the fundamental process of aging and use it to prevent aging.

### Tissue Aging Detection

We discovered that normal tissue aging can be captured with no training using high resolution tissue images (H&E). This breakthrough allows for non-invasive assessment of tissue age.

### Telomere Length Analysis

Our lab has developed novel deep learning frameworks that can determine telomere length of tissue using mere tissue images. This innovation offers new insights into cellular aging mechanisms.

### Current Projects

- Developing AI models to predict biological age from tissue samples
- Creating computational tools to identify aging biomarkers
- Exploring the relationship between telomere dynamics and tissue function
