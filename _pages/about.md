# Welcome to SinhaLab

We build computational methods to better understand the fundamental process of aging and use it to prevent aging.

## Our Research Focus

At SinhaLab, our central goal is to understand the fundamental process of aging using big data and advanced machine learning approaches. We develop novel computational methods to analyze how tissues age and identify potential interventions to prevent age-related decline.
Our current research focuses on leveraging high-resolution tissue pathology images available at scale to establish the principles of how different tissue architectures deteriorate over time. We use these images to identify molecular regulators through multi-omics approaches, assess lifestyle and genetic risk factors from electronic health records, and develop methods to detect aging signatures from blood samples.
Our Approach
We apply and develop cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning techniques to extract meaningful biological insights from tissue images. Our lab has pioneered several innovative methods, including:

TLPath: A computational approach to determine bulk-telomere length from standard histopathology images, providing new insights into cellular aging mechanisms
Multi-modal learning architectures: Novel frameworks that integrate transcriptomics with imaging data to enhance the detection of age-related tissue changes

Our interdisciplinary approach combines computational biology, machine learning, and biomedical imaging to address complex questions about the aging process that weren't previously accessible through traditional methods.

## Our Team
We are a diverse team comprising expertise spanning machine learning, bioengineering, computer vision, and omics analysis:
Dr. Mudra Choudhary (Computational Biologist) focuses on applying computational methodologies and machine learning techniques to unravel the complex relationship between aging and tissue architecture using multi-omics data.
Sanmi Adileye (NSF Graduate Research Fellow) brings expertise in computer science and robotics, applying advanced computational approaches to analyze complex biological datasets and develop new methodologies.
Anamika Yadav (Research Assistant) contributes to our open-source development efforts and applies her machine learning expertise to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale biological datasets.
Kyle Alvarez (LEAP Fellow in AI & Therapeutics) specializes in developing and utilizing advanced tools for analyzing complex biological datasets, integrating machine learning with bioinformatics to enhance our research capabilities.
Ranjit Kumar Sinha (Research Associate) leverages his industry experience and expertise in data science, statistical analysis, and Python programming to develop computational tools for aging research.

Through our innovative computational approaches, SinhaLab aims to estabish the principle of the aging process.
