  <h1>Understanding Aging through Computational Biology</h1>
</div>

## Welcome to SinhaLab

We build computational methods to better understand the fundamental process of aging and develop strategies to prevent age-related decline.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #5585B5; padding-left: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
Our lab pioneered new computational approaches that can characterize tissue aging using routine clinical data, offering unprecedented insights into the biological mechanisms of aging.

## Our Mission

At SinhaLab, our central goal is to understand the fundamental process of aging using big data and advanced machine learning approaches. We leverage multiple data types from image to multi-omics to electronic health records to develop a comprehensive view of tissue aging.

## Research Focus

Our current research focuses on three key areas:

<div class="row" style="display: flex; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <div class="col-md-4" style="flex: 1; padding: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Tissue Architecture Aging</h3>
    <p>We leverage high-resolution pathology images available at scale to establish principles of how different tissues deteriorate with age.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4" style="flex: 1; padding: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Molecular Regulators</h3>
    <p>We identify the molecular drivers of aging through integrated multi-omics approaches to find potential intervention targets.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4" style="flex: 1; padding: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Risk & Detection</h3>
    <p>We assess lifestyle and genetic risk factors from electronic health records and develop methods to detect aging signatures from blood.</p>
  </div>

## Our Innovations

Our lab has pioneered several innovative computational methods:

- **TLPath**: A deep learning framework that determines bulk-telomere length from standard histopathology images, providing insights into cellular aging mechanisms
- **Multi-modal Learning Architectures**: Novel approaches integrating transcriptomics with imaging data to enhance detection of age-related tissue changes

Our interdisciplinary approach combines computational biology, machine learning, and biomedical imaging to address complex questions about aging that weren't accessible through traditional methods.
