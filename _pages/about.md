  <h1>Understanding Aging through Computational Biology</h1>
</div>

## Welcome to SinhaLab

We build computational methods to better understand the fundamental process of aging and develop strategies to prevent age-related decline.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #5585B5; padding-left: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
Our lab pioneered new computational approaches that can characterize tissue aging using routine clinical data, offering unprecedented insights into the biological mechanisms of aging.

## Our Mission

At SinhaLab, our central goal is to understand the fundamental process of aging using big data and advanced machine learning approaches. We leverage multiple data types from image to multi-omics to electronic health records to develop a comprehensive view of tissue aging.

## Research Focus

Our current research focuses on three key areas:

<div class="row" style="display: flex; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <div class="col-md-4" style="flex: 1; padding: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Tissue Architecture Aging</h3>
    <p>Establish principles of how different tissues deteriorate with age and its molecular regulators.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4" style="flex: 1; padding: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Aging and Cancer</h3>
    <p>Breakdown how aging tissues transform to form a tumor beyond mutations. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4" style="flex: 1; padding: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Digital Pathology</h3>
    <p>Developing tools to use rich high-resolution tumor and non-tumor histopathology images.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Our Innovations

Our lab has pioneered the below few computational methods.

- ecPath: We deomstrated for the first time ecDNA can be detected from histopathology images using ecPath - a multimodal deep learning using both images and expression.
- PERCEPTION: First computational framework to choose cancer patient using their rich single cell rna-seq for kinase targeted therapies.
- DeepTarget: A method to find direct and indirect targets of cancer drugs driving their vitro killing.

Our interdisciplinary approach combines computational biology, machine learning, and biomedical imaging to address complex questions about aging that weren't accessible through traditional methods.
