Dr. Choudhary is the developer of ecPath and currently focuses on applying computational methodologies and machine learning techniques to unravel the complex relationship between aging and cancer. Previously, she did her PhD breaking down RNA editing dysregulation in neuropsychiatric diseases at UCLA in the Xiao lab.

### Sanmi Adileye, **Postdoc Fellow**
Sanmi did his PhD in Computer Science at the Contextual Robotics Institute at UC-San Diego. With experience at Robotics and Computer Vision, Sanmi brings advanced computer vision experience.

### Anamika Yadav, **Research Assistant**
Anamika joined our lab in October 2024. She previously worked as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and as an Open Source Developer for Google Summer of Code. One of her interst is to understand reproductive aging and develop interventions against it.

### Kyle Alvarez, **LEAP Fellow**
Kyle brings strong skills in bioinformatics and computational biology to our team. Proficient in BLAST, Bioconductor, R, and Python. He previously worked as a Machine Learning Programmer at La Jolla Labs Inc.

### Ranjit Kumar Sinha, **Research Associate**
Ranjit has industry experience in data science and is now focused on research. He specializes in Python programming and statistical data analysis, contributing to the development of our computational tools for aging research.

### Lauren Molony, **PhD Student**
Lauren is focused on neuroscience drug discovery and computational biology, with research experience in neuroimaging, EEG, and organoid models across multiple UCSD labs, having completed her BS in Neurobiology and Neurosciences from UC San Diego in 2023.
